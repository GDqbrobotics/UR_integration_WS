**control_loop** runs the main script, it uses a RTDE socket connection to send waypoints to the UR. It also subscribes to a mqtt topic. 
The project aim to create an interface between Vision (who pubs wp through mqtt) and UR (who listen to socket)

To test this project:

1) Powerup and release breaks of the UR
2) TCP/IP connect PC to UR
3) run __python control_loop.py__
4) run on UR the program **rtde_control_loop.urp**
5) To fake vision commands, run __python publisher.py__. It will send the pick targets read from targets.txt

The integration of the vision system, other than calibration, needs to have a part of code that sends targets through mqtt as 'publisher.py' does
